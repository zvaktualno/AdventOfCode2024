Advent of Code Solutions in Rust
================================

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges implemented in Rust. As I dive into learning Rust, I'm using these problems as a way to practice the language and improve my problem-solving skills.

About
-----

This project is a personal endeavor to learn Rust while tackling the Advent of Code challenges. I'm excited to share my progress and solutions as I advance through the puzzles.

Advent of Code
--------------

Advent of Code is an annual event comprising 25 daily coding puzzles released throughout December. It covers various algorithmic problems that test coding skills and problem-solving abilities. For more information, visit [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Folder Structure
----------------

Each day's solution is organized within its respective folder, following the convention `aoc_day_x` for the day number. Inside each folder, you'll find:

*   `src/`: Contains the Rust source code for solving the specific day's puzzle.
*   `input.txt`: Input data provided for that particular puzzle.
*   `test1.txt`: Test input data provided for that particular puzzle sample part one.
*   `test2.txt`: Test input data provided for that particular puzzle sample part two.

Usage
-----

To run any of the solutions, ensure you have Rust installed. Navigate to the specific day's folder and use Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system:


```
cd aoc_day-X
cargo run
```

Replace `X` with the day number you wish to run.
